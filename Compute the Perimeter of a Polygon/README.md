# Compute the Perimeter of a Polygon

[hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/lambda-march-compute-the-perimeter-of-a-polygon/problem)

In fact, I still don't know how to write haskell and fp.

First, store coordinates in strXY [[strX, strY]].

Then, calc the distance between strXY!!i and strXY!!(i+1)

Finally sum it.
